# Sign Language Detection Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop a sign language detection system using computer vision techniques. The goal is to recognize and interpret gestures made in sign language and translate them into text or spoken language. The system can be used to bridge communication barriers between individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing and those who do not understand sign language.

## Features
The sign language detection system provides the following features:

1. **Real-time Gesture Recognition**: The system can analyze video input in real-time and detect hand gestures used in sign language.

2. **Multiple Gesture Recognition**: It can recognize a wide range of hand gestures and signs from different sign languages, making it adaptable to various communication needs.

3. **Translation to Text or Speech**: Detected gestures can be translated into either text or spoken language to facilitate communication between sign language users and non-sign language users.

4. **User-friendly Interface**: The system includes a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the system easily and intuitively.

5. **Custom Gesture Training**: Users have the option to train the system with custom gestures or signs specific to their needs or a particular sign language.

6. **Integration**: The system can be integrated with other applications or devices to enable sign language communication in different contexts, such as video conferencing platforms or assistive devices.

## Installation

To install and run the sign language detection project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/username/sign-language-detection.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   
   pip install numpy
   pip install mediapipe
   pip install opencv-python
   

4. Download the pre-trained models for hand detection and gesture recognition. These models should be placed in the `models` directory.

5. Run the main application:
   ```
   
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the application by running `main.py`.

2. The application will start the webcam feed and display it on the screen.

3. Position your hands in front of the camera, making the desired sign language gestures.

4. The application will detect and recognize the gestures, displaying the corresponding text or speaking it aloud.

5. Optionally, you can train the system with custom gestures by following the instructions in the user interface.

6. To exit the application, press `Q` or `Esc` key.
